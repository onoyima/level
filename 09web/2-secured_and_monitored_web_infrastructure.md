Enhanced Security and Monitoring for Web Infrastructure

Description
This web infrastructure comprises three servers, emphasizing security measures and proactive monitoring while ensuring encrypted traffic.

Specifics of the Infrastructure
Firewall Functionality: Firewalls serve as protective barriers, safeguarding the web servers from unauthorized access and malicious traffic. They act as intermediaries between the internal and external networks, filtering incoming traffic to block any unwanted or unauthorized attempts.

SSL Certificate Purpose: SSL certificates encrypt traffic between web servers and the external network, thwarting potential threats like man-in-the-middle attacks and network sniffing. These certificates ensure privacy, integrity, and identification of communication channels.

Monitoring Clients Role: Monitoring clients are instrumental in overseeing server performance and network health. They analyze server operations, detect anomalies, and alert administrators of any deviations from expected behavior. By continuously assessing server accessibility, response times, and potential errors, monitoring clients ensure prompt issue identification and resolution.

Issues with the Infrastructure
SSL Termination at Load Balancer: Terminating SSL at the load balancer could leave traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data. Implementing end-to-end encryption is essential to mitigate this risk.

Single MySQL Server Scalability: Relying on a single MySQL server poses scalability challenges and increases the risk of a single point of failure. Implementing a clustered or distributed database architecture would enhance scalability and fault tolerance.

Uniform Server Components: Identical server configurations may lead to resource contention and performance issues. To optimize performance and scalability, consider diversifying server components based on workload requirements and implementing load balancing techniques to distribute resources efficiently. Additionally, employing scalable and modular architectures facilitates future expansion and resource allocation adjustments.
