Simplified Web Infrastructure
Many websites rely on a basic web setup, often consisting of just one server using a LAMP stack.

This setup involves a single server hosting a website accessible via www.foobar.com. Here's how it works:

Key Components of this Setup
Infrastructure Overview:

Server (8.8.8.8): This is either a physical or virtual machine running Linux, responsible for hosting the entire web application.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com): This human-readable address is configured with a DNS "A" record pointing to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), allowing users to locate the server.

Web Server (Nginx): Nginx handles incoming HTTP requests, serving static content, managing SSL/TLS encryption, and potentially load balancing.

Application Server: This executes the server-side logic of the web application, handling dynamic code and interfacing with the database.

Application Files: These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code like PHP or Python, executed by the application server.

Database (MySQL): MySQL stores and manages the application's data, handling queries and storage.

Explanation of Components:

Server Functionality: The server hosts the web application, providing services over the internet.

Role of the Domain Name: www.foobar.com acts as a pointer to the server's IP address, making it easier for users to access the site.

DNS Record Type: "www" is typically configured as a CNAME or A record in the DNS.

Web Server's Role: Nginx manages incoming HTTP requests, handles encryption, and can balance traffic.

Application Server's Role: It executes dynamic code and communicates with the database.

Database Functionality: Stores and retrieves application data.

Server Communication with Users: The server communicates with users' computers using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

Challenges with this Setup:

Single Point of Failure: If the server fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible. Redundancy measures like backup servers and load balancing can mitigate this.

Downtime during Maintenance: Web server restarts for maintenance can cause temporary downtime. Load balancers and multiple application server instances help maintain service continuity.

Limited Scalability: Handling increased traffic requires horizontal scaling with additional servers and load balancing.
